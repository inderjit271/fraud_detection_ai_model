4. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Effective for high-dimensional data

## Performance Metrics

The system evaluates models using:
- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness
- **Precision**: True positive rate among predicted positives
- **Recall**: True positive rate among actual positives
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **AUC-ROC**: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve

## Error Handling

The application includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Invalid file uploads
- Missing or incorrect column formats
- Data processing errors
- Model training failures
- Visualization errors

All errors display user-friendly messages with guidance for resolution.
